# Welcome to pypethon

This is a repository for the [PyTennessee](https://www.pytennessee.org) 2015 talk [Write a Toy Language in Python 3](https://www.pytennessee.org/schedule/presentation/50/). For an even gentler introduction to the concepts in this tutorial, you may enjoy working through [Romnomnom](https://github.com/tsclausing/romnomnom) first.

The README below includes a quickstart tutorial. Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/tsclausing/pypethon/wiki) for documentation.
